What is GraphQL?
----------------
GraphQL is a specification for an expressive data query language for APIs. It allows you to describe your data, request what you want from your data and receive a response back in the same shape as your request - only the fields you requested with the same field names. GraphQL is a strongly typed server-side runtime allowing you to traverse from the entry point to related data, following relationships defined in the schema, in a single request.

Many options for implementation on the server and client side are available.

GraphQL was internally developed by Facebook. It was publicly released in 2015.

For more information about the history of GraphQL see `GraphQL.org

Why is Inomial using GraphQL?
