GraphQL introduction
====================

GraphQL is a specification for an expressive data query language for APIs. It allows you to describe your data, request what you want from your data and receive a response back in the same shape as your request - only the fields you requested with the same field names. GraphQL is a strongly typed server-side runtime allowing you to traverse from the entry point to related data, following relationships defined in the schema, in a single request.

Many options for implementation on the server and client side are available.

GraphQL was internally developed by Facebook. It was publicly released in 2015.
